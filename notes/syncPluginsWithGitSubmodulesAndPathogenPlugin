using github to synchronize vim customizations

vim configurations are in .vimrc in ~/

customizations for graphical vim are in .gvimrc

scripts are in a dir called .vim in ~/

.vimrc and .gvimrc can be moved into .vim

you have to create a symbolic link from the old .vimrc and .gvimrc to the dirs in ~/.vim

you can then easily install the vim configuration files on any machine that has git installed

publish your vim configuration files to github

create a new repository in github, push (upload) instructions are on github

next step is installing to new machine, all you have to do is have git and vim installed on the new system

then you follow your README to create symbolic links and pull (download) the latest vers to local

SYNCHRONIZING PLUGINS

typically, to install vim plugins, you copy each script in the plugin into a corresponding .vim subdirectory

when you follow the typical installation procedure, your scripts end up distributed differently from the git repository, and updating them is thus disrupted.

To reconcile installation and preserve version control, pathogen is a plugin that allows all plugin files to exist in a single directory.

go to root ~/.vim directory
